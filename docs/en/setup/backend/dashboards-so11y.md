# OAP self observability dashboard

SkyWalking itself collects and exports metrics in Prometheus format for consuming,
it also provides a dashboard to visualize the self-observability metrics.

## Data flow
1. SkyWalking OAP collects metrics data internally and exposes a Prometheus http endpoint to retrieve the metrics.
2. SkyWalking OAP itself (or OpenTelemetry Collector, preferred in Kubernetes scenarios) fetches metrics from the Prometheus endpoint in step (1).
3. OAP (or OpenTelemetry Collector) pushes metrics to SkyWalking OAP Server via OpenTelemetry gRPC exporter.
4. The SkyWalking OAP Server parses the expression with [MAL](../../concepts-and-designs/mal.md) to filter/calculate/aggregate and store the results.

## Set up
Follow [OAP Self Observability Telemetry doc](backend-telemetry.md) to set up OAP and OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Self observability monitoring
Self observability monitoring provides monitoring of the status and resources of the OAP server itself. `oap-server` is a `Service` in OAP, and land on the `Layer: SO11Y_OAP`.

## Customizations
You can customize your own metrics/expression/dashboard panel.
The metrics definition and expression rules are found in `/config/fetcher-prom-rules/self.yaml` and `config/otel-rules/oap.yaml`.
The self observability dashboard panel configurations ship from the SkyWalking Horizon UI bundle (apache/skywalking-horizon-ui); the OAP backend no longer hosts UI dashboard JSONs.
